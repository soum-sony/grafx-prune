Our code uses our companion work `GRAFX`; please refer to [this repository](https://github.com/sh-lee97/grafx)
for more details.

To obtain a graph for a single song, e.g., `TablaBreakbeatScience_Rocksteady` from `MedleyDB`, run the following script:

``` bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python3 train.py \
    config=prune_hybrid_1e_2 \
    dataset=medley \
    song=TablaBreakbeatScience_RockSteady
```
``` bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python3 train.py \
    config=prune_hybrid_1e_2 \
    dataset=mixing_secrets_excerpts \
    song=DaimonB_AnotherLife2
```


To simply train a full mixing console, you can pass `config=mixing_console_full` instead.
All the arguments can be overriden from the cli. For more details, see `configs/base.yaml`.
